Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer
===
>  I am data scientist, AI enthuiest, and futurist with a passion for intelligent systems and thier potential for making major advances in society and technology in the coming years.  In the next   decade we will see systems that augment, analyze, and predict aspects of human intelligence in ways that will change society forever, and I want to be a contributor to this process as the world makes important decisions about the use and design of these powerful tools.

> ## Education

**Extensive Self-Study Computer Science Education** 

* I am dedicated lifetime self learner who began by loosely following the MIT syllabus for computer science and covered all standard courses on programming, data structures, operating systems, design patterns, and database systems. I also studied extensive math and statistics including discrete mathematics, signals and systems, linear algebra, and probabilities, as well as software security, network engineering, embedded systems, network security, machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and many other subjects using textbooks, online moocs, courses, and lectures.

> ## Technical and Artistic Expertise

**Audio Engineering, Recording, and Production Experience**
* I have a lifelong interest and passion for audio engineering, music production and recording, synthesizers, and music production technology in general. I have decades of experience with pro audio hardware and software, and recently I've become particularly fascinated by the intersection of music production and generative neural networks.
